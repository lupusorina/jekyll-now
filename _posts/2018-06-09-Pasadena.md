title: 5 thing I've discovered to be awesome in Pasadena
---

I'm going to talk about some cool things I've discovered since I moved to Pasadena.


### 1. Santa Fe Dam Radio Control Modelers Club
I went there with Patrick during their Open House in March. Very close to Pasadena (15 min by car), there is a big land with a runway where you can fly powered RC planes, helicopters or quadcopters.

The registration fee is approximately 100 USD per year, and you need to be an AMA member. The cool part is that you can go there and fly anytime you want. There are trees and tables, and sometimes they organize bbqs.
After we got our membership, we went there several times already. I already broke a prop and almost the landing gear, but everyone is very welcoming and they don't make fun of you if you are not proficient.


Below, that's me with the nose-landed plane, painted by Patrick with the Swiss flag.

### 2. McMaster Carr - my favourite shop

The coolest store ever. They carry everything you need to build everything you've ever imagined.
That place is a huge stockroom with components that deliver same day or next day. They also provide the STL model of the parts.

I sometimes spend time just scrolling over their parts, it's really fun.


### 3. 21 choices

That place is always hyper-crowded. They sell magic frozen yogurt. The cool part is its preparation.

You can choose what the icecream should have (like brownies, cookies, strawberries, fruits) and then the vendors are cutting each of the ingredients really small and are mixing them with the froyo. In the end, it looks like an awesome sweet paste.
Very bad if you are on a diet (which is my default state since I moved to the US).

### 4. The 3d printers from my professor's lab (Markforged)

Named internally Corgi and Pitbull (because we like dogs), those 3d printers are awesome. They have very good personality/resolution and the parts are looking highly professional. In addition, you can add reinforcement of carbon fibre or kevlar if you want, which makes your parts really strong.

### 5. Dinner food at Caltech

Cause I don't have time (and I don't like) to cook.
In fact, the dinner at Caltech is 100 times better than the lunch (don't know why). It's also less crowded if you decide to dine at 5:30.

What I miss?
- parents
- clouds (Cali sky is either completely uncovered or completely covered by clouds)
- green (cause desert color is to dull for my taste)
